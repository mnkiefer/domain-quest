For doctors aiming to identify heart attacks (acute myocardial infarctions), the most useful visualizations and analyses focus on risk factors and diagnostic criteria that are clinically significant.

Here are the most relevant and actionable plots for this purpose:


# Diagnostic Feature Relationships

## Boxplots/Violin Plots of Key Variables by Output

- **Goal**: Show how heart attack outcomes (output: 1 = heart attack, 0 = no heart attack) are associated with features.
- **Focus Variables**:
    - `thalachh` (maximum heart rate achieved)
    - `oldpeak` (ST depression induced by exercise)
    - `cp` (chest pain type)
    - `exng` (exercise-induced angina)
    - `O2 saturation` (if low, it may indicate poor oxygen delivery, a heart failure risk).
- **Example**: Boxplot of oldpeak grouped by output to see if elevated ST depression correlates with heart attacks.

## Correlation Heatmap

- **Goal**: Highlight relationships between variables that strongly correlate with heart attacks.
Include features like `oldpeak`, `thalachh`, `trtbps` (resting blood pressure), and `O2 saturation`.
Helps focus on combinations of factors that doctors can prioritize.


# Risk Stratification

## Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve

- **Goal**: Assess the predictive power of features like `O2 saturation`, `thalachh`, `cp`, and `oldpeak` in identifying heart attacks.
Useful for validating thresholds (e.g., critical `thalachh` value below which risk is higher).

## Decision Tree Visualization

- **Goal**: Simplify how features interact to predict heart attack outcomes.
Helps doctors understand key thresholds (e.g., `oldpeak` > 2, `thalachh` < 120) for making clinical decisions.


# Specific Symptom and Risk Profiles

## Bar Plot of Chest Pain Types (cp)

- **Goal**: Compare the frequency of chest pain types (`cp`: typical angina, atypical angina, non-anginal pain, or asymptomatic) between heart attack and non-heart attack cases.
Chest pain is a primary symptom; visualizing its distribution improves diagnostic focus.

## Scatter Plot of thalachh vs. oldpeak

- **Goal**: Identify clusters or patterns. For example:
Low `thalachh` (max HR) combined with high `oldpeak` indicates higher risk.

## Boxplot of O2 Saturation by output

Goal: If `O2 saturation` data is available, visualize its relationship with outcomes to detect hypoxia-related risks.


# Multivariate Analysis

## Pair Plot

- **Goal**: Compare interactions among key variables like `oldpeak`, `thalachh`, `O2 saturation`, `age`, and output to identify high-risk profiles.
Doctors can visually recognize patterns in feature combinations.

## Cluster Analysis

- **Goal**: Group patients with similar profiles based on critical variables (`oldpeak`, `thalachh`, `cp`, etc.).
Helps define archetypal heart attack presentations.


# Stress Test Insights

## Line Plot of `thalachh` vs. Time (if Time Data Available)

- **Goal**: Show changes in heart rate during stress tests to identify abnormal patterns.

## Scatter Plot of `exng` (Exercise-Induced Angina) vs. `oldpeak`

- **Goal**: Relate stress-induced chest pain to ST depression to highlight ischemia.
